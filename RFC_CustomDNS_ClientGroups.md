# RFC: Custom DNS Client Groups Support

## Request For Change: Client-Specific DNS Configuration

**Author**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Version**: 1.0  

---

## Executive Summary

This RFC proposes adding **Client Groups** support to Blocky's Custom DNS resolver, enabling different DNS configurations (mappings, rewrite rules, zone files) for different clients based on IP address, client name patterns, or CIDR subnets. This addresses the limitation where all clients currently receive identical DNS resolution, preventing network administrators from providing tailored DNS services to different device types, networks, or user groups. This empowers Blocky to offer split-horizon DNS capabilities.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

Blocky's existing Custom DNS resolver applies a single, global configuration to all clients. This creates several operational challenges:

**1. Lack of Client Segmentation**
- All clients receive identical DNS mappings regardless of their identity, location, or purpose
- No ability to provide different internal domain mappings to different network segments
- Impossible to customize DNS behavior based on device type or user group

**2. Security and Isolation Issues**
- No way to limit DNS-based service discovery to authorized networks

**3. Operational Complexity**
- Network administrators must deploy multiple Blocky instances for client-specific DNS
- Complex network routing required to achieve client-specific DNS behavior

### Real-World Impact

- If a NAS has multiple network devices each tied to a specific VLAN, the NAS requires multiple DNS entries for each network device.
- Domains cannot resolve to the internal network for local devices while still allowing access to VPN users via the same domain.
- Family devices access `nas.home` → `192.168.1.50` while guest devices cannot resolve internal services

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture Overview

Implement **Client Groups** as an extension to the existing Custom DNS resolver, providing:

1. **Client-Specific Configuration**: Each client group has independent DNS mappings, rewrite rules, and zone files
2. **Priority-Based Resolution**: Hierarchical client matching with clear precedence rules
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configurations continue working without modification
4. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Legacy deployments remain fully functional

### Technical Design

#### Client Group Resolution Priority

```
1. Exact IP Address Match (192.168.1.100)     [Highest Priority]
2. Client Name Wildcard Pattern (laptop*)     [Second Priority]
3. CIDR Subnet Match (192.168.1.0/24)         [Third Priority]
4. Default Group Fallback                      [Lowest Priority]
```

#### Configuration Structure

```yaml
customDNS:
  # Global settings (inherited by all groups)
  customTTL: 1h
  filterUnmappedTypes: true

  clientGroups:
    # Default fallback group
    default:
      mapping:
        router.lan: 192.168.1.1

    # Exact IP match - highest priority
    192.168.1.100:
      mapping:
        server.local: 10.0.0.100
        api.local: 10.0.0.101

    # Client name patterns - second priority
    laptop*:
      mapping:
        dev.local: 192.168.1.50

    # CIDR subnet - third priority
    192.168.10.0/24:
      mapping:
        staging.local: 192.168.10.100
```

#### Implementation Components

**1. Configuration Extension** (`config/custom_dns.go`)
- Add `ClientGroups map[string]CustomDNSGroup` to existing structure
- Implement automatic migration from legacy format to client groups
- Maintain full backward compatibility with existing configurations

**2. Client Resolution Engine** (`resolver/custom_dns_resolver.go`)
- `resolveClientGroup()`: Implements priority-based client group selection
- `getClientGroupConfig()`: Returns appropriate DNS configuration for resolved group
- Handles both legacy single-config mode and new client groups mode

**3. Migration System**
- Automatic detection of legacy configurations
- Seamless upgrade to "default" client group
- Warning logs with migration guidance for administrators

### Feature Completeness

Each client group supports **full feature parity** with the existing Custom DNS resolver:

- **Simple Mappings**: Domain → IP address mappings
- **Domain Rewriting**: Pattern-based domain transformation before resolution
- **Zone Files**: Complete DNS zone file support with all record types
- **Reverse DNS**: Automatic PTR record generation for all defined addresses
- **CNAME Resolution**: Full CNAME following with loop protection

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Enhanced Network Segmentation
- **Isolated DNS Namespaces**: Different client groups resolve different internal services
- **Security Boundaries**: Sensitive services only accessible to authorized client groups

### 2. Operational Flexibility
- **Single Instance Deployment**: One Blocky instance serves multiple client configurations
- **Centralized Management**: All DNS configurations managed in one place
- **Dynamic Client Handling**: New clients automatically assigned to appropriate groups

### 3. Scalability Improvements
- **Reduced Infrastructure**: Eliminates need for multiple DNS instances
- **Simplified Network Architecture**: No complex routing for DNS differentiation
- **Lower Maintenance Overhead**: Single configuration file instead of multiple deployments

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Performance Impact

**Positive:**
- Eliminates need for multiple Blocky instances (reduces resource usage)
- Single DNS query path with minimal overhead
- Cached client group resolution for repeated queries from same client

**Potential Concerns:**
- **Client Group Lookup Overhead**: Each query requires client group resolution
- **Configuration Size**: Large client group configurations may increase memory usage
- **CIDR Matching Cost**: Subnet matching requires IP arithmetic for each CIDR group

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Benchmark testing shows <1ms additional latency for client group resolution
- Most deployments will have <10 client groups, keeping lookup cost minimal
- Future optimization opportunities: client group caching, efficient CIDR trees

### Configuration Complexity

**Increased Configuration Surface:**
- Administrators must understand client group priority rules
- More complex YAML structure compared to simple global mappings
- Potential for misconfiguration if priority rules are misunderstood

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive documentation with examples for common scenarios
- Clear priority hierarchy that matches intuitive expectations
- Automatic migration preserves existing functionality
- Validation warnings for potential configuration issues

### Backward Compatibility Risks

**Risk**: Breaking existing deployments during upgrade

**Mitigation:**
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing configurations continue working identically
- **Automatic Migration**: Legacy configs automatically become "default" group
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Clear guidance for updating to new format
- **Dual Support**: Both legacy and client group modes supported indefinitely

### Maintenance Burden

**Additional Complexity:**
- More code paths to test and maintain
- Client group resolution logic requires ongoing maintenance
- Documentation must cover both legacy and client group modes

**Benefits Outweigh Costs:**
- Eliminates operational complexity of multiple DNS instances
- Reduces overall system complexity by consolidating DNS configurations
- Strong test coverage ensures reliable operation

---

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Multiple Blocky Instances
**Approach**: Deploy separate Blocky instances for different client groups
**Rejected Because:**
- Requires complex network routing to direct clients to appropriate instances
- Multiplies infrastructure and maintenance overhead
- No dynamic client assignment capabilities
- Difficult to manage and scale

### 2. Upstream Groups to a multiple Upstream Groups
**Approach**: Define upstream groups in Blocky in order to route requests to different DNS servers based on client IP
**Rejected Because:**
- Requires a DNS Server for each upstream group, making management difficult
- Complicates deployment and configuration

### 3. Utilize CoreDNS with Views and set Blocky as the upstream resolver
**Approach**: Make CoreDNS the entry point for DNS requests and use its view plugin to separate clients into groups, then forward requests to Blocky
**Rejected Because:**
- Blocky loses the ability to determine the Client IP, preventing blocklists from applying to groups.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Backward Compatibility (Immediate)
- All existing configurations continue working without changes
- Automatic migration logs warn about deprecated format
- Documentation updated with client group examples

### Phase 2: Adoption Period (3-6 months)
- Users gradually migrate to client group format
- Legacy format remains fully supported
- Community feedback guides refinements

### Phase 3: Long-term Support (Ongoing)
- Both formats supported indefinitely for stability
- New features may only be available in client group format
- Legacy format becomes maintenance-only

### Example Migration

**Before (Legacy Format):**
```yaml
customDNS:
  mapping:
    server.lan: 192.168.1.100
    printer.lan: 192.168.1.50
```

**After (Client Groups Format):**
```yaml
customDNS:
  clientGroups:
    default:
      mapping:
        server.lan: 192.168.1.100
        printer.lan: 192.168.1.50
```

**Automatic Migration Result:**
- Legacy configuration automatically becomes `default` client group
- Identical functionality and behavior preserved
- Warning logged suggesting configuration update
